MATLAB code used for Alex Whitebirch's paper (Whitebirch et al., Neuron 2022)

I_F_051022: used to count action potentials in response to 1-second depolarizing current. 

binned_slowdeltaVm_051022: used to measure and bin the slow ramping depolarization in CA2 PNs.

postsynaptic_current_time_constant_051022: used to measure and bin the time constant Tau for EPSCs and IPSCs.

SR_PSP_hist_cdf_pdf_051022: used to construct the probability density function that describes the timing of SR-evoked peak hyperpolarization.

Rin_Tau_Cm_051022: used to measure the input resistance, membrane time constant, and membrane capacitance. 

spikeanalysis_051022: used to measure action potential characteristics, including rheobase current, threshold, and afterhyperpolarization.
